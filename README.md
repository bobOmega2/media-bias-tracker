# Media Bias Tracker

Media Bias Tracker is a data-driven web application that analyzes potential bias in media content by combining AI-based analysis with user feedback. The goal is to make bias more transparent and encourage more thoughtful, critical engagement with the media people consume.

## Vision
I am passionate about understanding the world through media, film, and storytelling. This project explores how technology and data can be used to surface perspectives, challenge assumptions, and help users reflect more critically on the information and media they engage with.

## Tech Stack
- Next.js (frontend + API routes)
- Supabase (PostgreSQL database, authentication)
- Python (data processing and bias scoring)
- OpenAI / LLMs (AI-based analysis)
